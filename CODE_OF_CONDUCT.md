# Code of Conduct

**TL;DR**: Be friendly, inclusive, respectful, and mindful of your fellow collaborators.

## Everyone's Responsibilities

As a contributor (commenter, code collaborator, feedback-provider, and so on), you are expected to:

- Maintain a welcoming and inclusive environment.
- Respect all other individuals regardless of different viewpoints and experiences.
- Gracefully accept constructive criticism.

### Inclusion

This community will be a harassment-free experience for every collaborator regardless of any part of
their identity.

### Professionalism

Of course, friendly language may result in acceptable banter between collaborators. So what is
acceptable and what is not? As a base example:

- Unwelcome sexual attention or advances are unacceptable.
- Attacks on a person for any reason is unacceptable.

## My Responsibilities

Maintainers are responsible for overseeing the standards of acceptable behaviour within this
project. This means we can and will edit, reject, and delete pull requests and issues if we can cite
instances of unacceptable behaviour.

## Scope

If you are representing the project or its community, we expect you to follow by the Code of
Conduct. The scope of the Code may also be extended to verifiable public interactions and/or
personal interactions if they cannot be resolved internally.

## Enforcement

You can send reports of Code-infringing behaviour directly to staff.

We are obligated to:

- Follow our own Code of Conduct.
- Maintain confidentiality concerning the reporter.
- Provide a response to the reporter.
- Provide transparency in verdict decision-making.

Verdicts handed out to contributors include (but are not limited to) warnings and blocks/bans.

## Attribution

This Code is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant][contributor-covenant] v1.4.
