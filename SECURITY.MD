# Security Policy

Inkling Interactive's engineering team takes security incredibly seriously, even with a straightforward policy.

## Supported Versions

Only the latest version of our software will be supported with security updates. In other words, patch versions will
only be applied to the latest current version of the software.

This applies to all repository types: binaries/apps, libraries, and APIs.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please don't raise security issues as GitHub Issues. Instead, please email the [security lead][keybase-paced].
