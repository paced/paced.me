Well, it's my own personal profile. Since it's open sourced, you're of course free to use it for
your own purposes. For that reason, if you find any problems that would apply to anybody who might
want to fork this repo, feel free to report those as issues.

I probably won't accept pull requests but that depends on what it is. Rest assured I check my GitHub
notifications on most weekdays, so I should get to an issue relatively quickly.
